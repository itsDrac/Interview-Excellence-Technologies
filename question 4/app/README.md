#### Question 4(b)

In this folder I have created a `flask` app which has three pages `login page`, `register page`, `update page` 
In **Register Page**, User can create an account by giving his e-mail and password. After creating an account user will be redirected to `login page`
In **Login Page**, User can log in using email he used while creating account for this, I have used `flask-login`
After logging in user can visit **Update Page** where user can update his email address
